# Pair Up Application 

## Purpose:
- Pair Up is an application that caters towards students learning software development. Our goal is to provide a central location where students can go to pair up with other students on projects to gain experience working in a team environment and while doing so, extend their development education and knowledge. 

## How it works:
- The application allows users to view monthly challenges and sign up for a challenge. After users have signed up for the challenge and the signup period has ended, the users will be placed in teams of 2-4 developers at random. Each team will complete the project and submit their final copies once completed. Teams will then have the ability to peer review the work of other teams and vote on the best project. 

- Each team will have a designated person as a team lead that acts as the organizer for the team (team lead will be 1 of the 2-4 members of the team). This person will be required to submit the final work for their team once completed. Although it is not required, we recommend that the person assigned this role organizes the development of the project as a real life team lead would do in a professional capacity. 

## Who can sign up:
- We would like to say that anyone can sign up for a project (which realistically, they can), however, we encourage students to only sign up for a challenge if their skill set meets the minimum requirements (provided for each challenge). This provides teams with students who are not only capable of working on the project but can also provide their teammates with an enjoyable and productive experience. 

## Levels of difficulty
- The challenges will range from easy to advanced. Some projects will focus on CLI programs while others will be full stack web applications. We intend to provide two complex challenges per month; one for beginner/novice students who are only familiar with the CLI and another project that focuses on web application challenges.
